Life Expectancy Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes global life expectancy data to understand how health, education, and economic factors influence lifespan across countries using WHO and UN data (2000–2015).

Dataset
2,938 records from 193 countries
Target variable: Life Expectancy

Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed to study distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
Strong associations were observed between life expectancy and schooling, healthcare indicators, and mortality rates.

Correlation Insights


Key Findings
Education and healthcare access have the strongest impact on life expectancy.
High mortality and disease prevalence significantly reduce lifespan.
Economic factors support life expectancy but are not the primary drivers.

Validation
Simple regression models were used only to validate analytical insights.

Conclusion
Life expectancy is driven mainly by health and education factors, with economic stability playing a secondary role.
