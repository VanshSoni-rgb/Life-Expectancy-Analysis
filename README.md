Life Expectancy Analysis

Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing global life expectancy data to understand how health, economic, and social factors influence human lifespan across different countries. The analysis is based on data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations for the period 2000 to 2015.

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis and build predictive models that help identify the most significant contributors to life expectancy. The insights derived can assist policymakers and researchers in prioritizing healthcare and social development initiatives.

Problem Statement  
Life expectancy differs widely across countries due to variations in healthcare access, immunization coverage, education levels, economic stability, and mortality rates. This project aims to analyze these factors and determine their relationship with life expectancy using data-driven techniques.
